# Pipeline

`run_pipeline.py` executes the numbered stages in dependency order.

| Stage | Script | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | `bulkRNAseq/01_prepare_inputs.py` | References, manifests, and local inputs |
| 02 | `bulkRNAseq/02_quantify_and_test.py` | DEG tables and bulk-RNAseq figures |
| 03 | `bulkRNAseq/03_render_figures.py` | Optional RNA-seq IGV tracks (`--igv-tracks`): local-SSD HISAT2 index build, MAPQ >=30/proper-pair filtering, CPM bigWigs, and group means |
| 04 | `CUT&RUN/04_align_and_normalize.py` | Alignments, filtered BAMs, and normalized tracks |
| 05 | `CUT&RUN/05_call_peaks_and_define_binding.py` | Peaks and promoter-bound genes |
| 06 | `CUT&RUN/06_render_figures.py` | CUT&RUN figures and promoter-priority peak-to-gene assignments |
| 07 | `regulatory_target/07_define_regulatory_targets.py` | Promoter-bound targets; shared-peak DEG figures only with `--shared-peaks` |
