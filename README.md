2. `bulkRNAseq/02_quantify_and_test.py`: bulk-RNAseq quantification and differential expression.
3. `bulkRNAseq/03_render_figures.py`: bulk-RNAseq figure rendering.
4. `CUT&RUN/04_align_and_normalize.py`: alignment, filtering, yeast normalization, and coverage tracks.
5. `CUT&RUN/05_call_peaks_and_define_binding.py`: matched-IgG peak calling, filtering, and promoter binding.
